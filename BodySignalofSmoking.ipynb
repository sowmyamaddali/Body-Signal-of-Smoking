Introduction\n","\n","Smoking cigarettes can have a variety of negative effects on the body, and there are several signals that can indicate that a person is a smoker. One of the most obvious signals is the smell of cigarette smoke on their breath, hair, and clothing. This smell can be quite strong and can linger for a long time, even after the person has finished smoking. In addition to the smell, smoking can also cause visible changes to a person's skin and teeth. For example, smokers may develop wrinkles and fine lines earlier than non-smokers, and their teeth may become yellowed or stained. \n","\n","\n","Smoking can also cause respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and wheezing. These symptoms can occur both during and after smoking, and can be indicative of lung damage caused by smoking. Over time, smoking can lead to more serious respiratory conditions, such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Smokers may also experience decreased lung function, which can make it harder for them to exercise or engage in other physical activities. Overall, smoking can have a number of negative effects on the body, and it is important to quit smoking in order to reduce the risk of developing serious health problems.\n","\n","Our analysis will focus on understanding how information of different body signals can be used to determine if a person is a smoker or not.The dataset used for this project has been taken from Kaggle and is titled [Body signal of smoking](https://https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kukuroo3/body-signal-of-smoking). The motivation for choosing this topic stems from a keen interest in public health and a desire to uncover potential insights from the data. By analyzing the body signals of smokers, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the health risks associated with smoking and contribute to the development of effective smoking cessation strategies.
